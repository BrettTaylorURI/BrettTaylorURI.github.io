    <h1>Welcome To Brett's Programming Portfolio</h1>
       <p> On this site I will be keeping track of my progress as a computer programmer. <br>
          I am currently taking CSC 106 at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
          This is my very first computer programming course. <br>
          I look forward to obtaining this new skill and using it in furture projects or interets that I may engage in.</p>

    <p>The “Avoid The Gems” game is to be used as a source of entertainment. <br>
     In the opening scene a button is displayed to start the game and the games title is highlighted at the top; the author of the game is also written at the bottom.<br>
     When the button is pressed the game loads and changes scenes. The setting of the game is a swamp and the gems you are trying to avoid are described as being toxic.<br>
     The main concept of the game being to get the bitmoji “Brett” to one side of the swamp and back,  avoiding the toxic gems. <br>
     If the bitmoji makes it to the opposing side of the swamp and back, 2 points are awarded, but if a gem is touched then a point is deducted from the players score.<br>
     The score is displayed and changes as certain actions occur, which can be seen towards the top left of the screen. When a player presses the spacebar, Brett hops, the speed that the bitmoji hops and falls are the same.<br>
     The strategy of the user is to pick the best timing in which they can cross over the swamp by hopping or falling (depending where they are located), avoiding the gems along the way.</p>
